# T-test paired on unpaired app

To run paired t-test:
- set Pairing factor in the wizard!

To run unpaired t-test:
- leave Pairing factor empty in the wizard
- inside the app, in the t-test step / settings, set the setting for pairing to "unpaired"!

Leaving the pairing factor empty, but not setting the pairing parameter in the t-test operator / settings will lead to the error message: "Labels are required for a paired test."
